      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white">Project Info</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">The project focuses on conducting tests on Dr hud's website to identify why there is some users dropping off at the camera stage. An investigation is carried out to assess whether the camera function should be placed earlier in the flow and if its appearance should be changed to enhance the user experience. Statistics show a significant drop-off in camera mode, and the project aims to reduce these drop-offs by implementing appropriate changes based on the results of the tests and investigations.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Goals </h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">The goal is to investigate why users abandon the process when they reach the camera mode and to propose changes to the flow or design of taking pictures for both the mobile and desktop versions.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Project development</h4>
      <ul class="text-white-50 mb-0">
        <li>Started with investigate why users discontinue in the camera mode. Since there wasn't enough statistical data to pinpoint the exact reasons, several user tests were conducted. </li>
        <li>A competitor analysis was conducted to observe how other companies have implemented similar functionalities.</li>
        <li>Interviews with users were they was asked about their opinions on the steps required to complete and take pictures. However, this yielded no results as everyone was satisfied with how it looked, but I received some input for changes. </li>
        <li>Subsequently, I chose to implement these changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Final deliverables</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">One of the deliverables was to identify why there was a significant drop-off when patients attempted to upload pictures. After conducting research, I found that when patients initiated a new case on the computer, the drop-off rate during the image upload flow was 33%. Another deliverable was to find a solution to this issue. After conducting further research and competitor analysis, I decided that the easiest way to address this was to allow users to upload pictures through mobile devices even if they had started the case on the computer. Therefore, in the second phase of the project, I created a new flow, wireframes, and prototype that provided users with the option to scan a QR code on the desktop with their mobile phones to upload pictures directly to the computer.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Summary</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">The most exciting part of this project was when I began testing the solution to the drop-off issue and how easily the development team could implement it. It involved some testing and meetings with them, but the design result was stunning, and they were able to implement it very quickly.</p>
