      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white">Project Info</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">Dr. Hud wanted me to develop guidelines for the company to facilitate aspects like color codes, fonts to be used, among others. This document can be shared with both internal and external stakeholders. The guidelines are based on Dr. Hud's new look for the website and the creation of a case page.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Goals</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">The goal is to create a clear guideline that the development team, UX/UI designers, and other stakeholders can follow when making adjustments to the product.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Project development </h4>
      <ul class="text-white-50 mb-0">
        <li>For this project, I had one week to develop a guideline. The first step was to inspect the entire new website and assess colors, fonts, text size, buttons, etc., on each page, as these elements were not documented. </li>
        <li>The next step was to design a guideline based on all of the above, which I would then seek approval for and made some small adjustments. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Final deliverables </h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">After I analyzed the homepage design, I began creating the guidelines. Some discussions with the development team were held just to try to standardize some buttons and spacing. The new guidelines include colors and primary colors, text and fonts, as well as color shades. Other guidelines such as how the colors must be used, the logo, and spacing (padding and gap between elements) were also established. After the new guidelines were accepted, I proceeded to Figma to implement the new design patterns.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Summary </h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">Thanks to the new guidelines, I made it possible for all parallel design projects and future projects to have an updated design system. Even in the first days of the project, some changes were made on the webpage to ensure the design quality and usability. This project was highly prioritized for the company, and time was fundamental to finish the guidelines as soon as possible so they could be implemented in other projects.</p>
