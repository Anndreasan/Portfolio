      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white">Project Info</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">This project is to significantly improve the clarity and precision of responses delivered by doctors during patient consultations. By ensuring that these responses are clear and explicit, we aim to eliminate misunderstandings or misinterpretations that could potentially arise among patients or other medical professionals involved in the patient's care. This enhancement will be achieved through the development and implementation of an innovative system that generates pre-filled answers tailored to the doctor's risk assessment conducted during each patient consultation.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Goals</h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">The project goal is to ensure that the response from the doctor is clear and cannot be misunderstood. This will be achieved by creating pre-filled answers based on the doctor's risk assessment.</p>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Project development </h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">This project took three weeks to complete, and I collaborated extensively with the backend team to make this project work. The steps to produce a final prototype were as follows:</p>
      <ul class="text-white-50 mb-0">
        <li>Research phase - on most common cancer skin cancer misdiagnoses </li>
        <li>Analysis - Based on the research and articles</li>
        <li>Wireframe - Prepopulating fields proposal </li>
        <li>Prototyping - Prepopulating fields proposal  </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Final deliverables </h4>
      <p class="text-white-50">One of the deliverables was to understand the consequences of a doctor misdiagnosing a birthmark for a patient, which I summarized into three categories:
        Patient's fault: Patients sometimes neglect to regularly check their birthmarks, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis if changes occur. Vigilance and prompt reporting of concerns are essential.
        Cancer's fault: Certain types of skin cancer, such as melanoma, may progress rapidly and be challenging to detect. Delays in diagnosis highlight the need for ongoing research and improved diagnostic methods for early detection.
        Doctor's fault: Doctors can contribute to delays in diagnosis by inaccurately assessing birthmarks or failing to communicate clearly about monitoring skin changes. Accurate assessments and clear communication are crucial for prompt reporting and treatment.
        The second deliverable was to create new guidelines for prepopulated answers:</p>
        <ul class="text-white-50 mb-0">
          <li>Pre-set responses should be based on clear criteria so that all doctors can assess in the same way. </li>
          <li>Pre-set responses should include important assessment information and clearly indicate the assessed risk level. Any additional information, such as the ABCDE method or Ugly Duckling method, should be provided separately via a link.</li>
          <li>Pre-set responses should always include an action, what the patient needs to do or not do.</li>
          <li>Pre-set responses should contain generic text and information based on the three criteria. It is desirable for these responses to be placed at the end of the assessment to allow the doctor to provide a personalized diagnosis or explanation based on the type of birthmark.</li>
          <li>Pre-set responses should specify that the assessment is based on the images and information provided by the patient within a specified timeframe.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Summary </h4>
        <p class="text-white-50">This project was crucial for Dr. Hud due to one of his core metrics: the doctor should be able to diagnose a patient within 5 minutes. The guidelines were not just perfect for birthmarks but also applicable to other skin diseases.</p>
