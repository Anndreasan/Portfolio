        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white">Project Info</h4>
        <p class="text-white-50">The goal of this project was to plan and conduct two A/B tests on the Rehabshop website. These tests aimed to determine whether changes to the website's homepage and account creation process could enhance user engagement and increase conversion rates. By analyzing visitor behavior using Google Analytics, I identified key areas for improvement and developed hypotheses to test their impact on user actions.</p>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Goals</h4>
        <p class="text-white-50">The primary goal was to increase the click-through rate (CTR) on the homepage and improve the conversion rate for account creation. Specifically, I aimed to raise the CTR for the "Try Now" button on the homepage to over 50% and reduce the percentage of visitors who do not create an account during the purchase process from 20% to below 12%.</p>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Project development </h4>
        <ul class="text-white-50 mb-0">
          <li>During the planning phase, I used Google Analytics to gather data on user behavior. I designed two versions of the homepage and the account creation process in Figma. Version A represented the current design, while Version B introduced new elements, such as a clearer call-to-action (CTA) button and more detailed product information on the homepage, as well as a "profile" icon for account creation accessible throughout the website.</li>
          <li>The tests were then executed by splitting users into two groups, each group exposed to either Version A or Version B. These tests ran for two weeks, reaching a total of 2,500 users per version for the homepage and 3,000 users for the account creation process.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Final deliverables </h4>
        <p class="text-white-50">Upon completion of the tests, I analyzed the data collected through Google Analytics. The results showed that Version B of the homepage, with its enhanced CTA button and additional information, achieved a 59% click-through rate compared to 36% for Version A. For the account creation process, Version B reduced the percentage of users not creating an account to 15%, though it did not fully meet the goal of lowering this figure below 12%.</p>
        <p class="text-white-50">Based on these findings, I recommended implementing the new homepage design. However, the decision on the account creation process was deferred for further testing due to the results not being as conclusive as desired.</p>
        <h4 class="text-4 font-weight-600 text-white mt-4">Summary </h4>
        <p class="text-white-50">This project involved planning and executing A/B tests on the Rehabshop website to optimize user engagement and conversion rates. The results highlighted the effectiveness of a clearer CTA and more informative design in increasing user interaction on the homepage, leading to the implementation of the new design. Further testing is recommended for the account creation process to achieve the targeted conversion rate.</p>
